# Manchester Baby

A simulator for the SSEM Manchester Baby I'm creating to develop my skills in binary arithmetic and emulation. Operations are done by parsing binary strings. There is definitely more efficient ways of doing the arithmetic which may be explored in a later date but this was made for the sake of implementing the handwritten binary parsing into software.
